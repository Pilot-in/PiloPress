# Add new layout

- In the admin menu `Pilo'Press > Layouts`, add a new layout
- Configure the layouts fields
- Create PHP, CSS and JS files in your theme layout folder `/your-theme/pilopress/layouts/your-layout`
- You have to name those files the same way you did in back-office settings. 

**NB:** only PHP file is mandatory.
